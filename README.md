# Computer-vision-in-warehouse
Applying computer vision to count rolls of material on pallets.

This program can recognize rolls (circles) on pallets (rectangles), count, and mark them. 

It can be used to capture increments of products on pallets and help to reduce human-factor mistakes.
Current release (just a POC) uses geometrical shapes. 
Production version will rely on haarcascades. 

Simple demo below. Original video is here: https://youtu.be/jtWf3Vpmqrg
